# cub3D - 3D Raycasting Game

## Description

cub3D is a walking simulator utilizing ray-casting techniques similar to Wolfenstein 3D. Developed as part of the Hive Helsinki curriculum with a bit of our own flare.

## Collaborators

- [Markus Laaksonen](https://github.com/mxafi)
- [Lionel](https://github.com/liocle)

## Technologies

Written in C, cub3D leverages MLX42, a compact graphics library similar to MiniLibX.

## Project Focus

- Proficient use of C
- Implementation of fundamental algorithms (e.g. DDA)
- Interaction with a minimal graphics library
- Emphasis on precision and rigor
- Collaboration within a team

## Features

- Map file parsing
- Map validation
- Raycast maze rendering
- Collision detection

## How to Use
